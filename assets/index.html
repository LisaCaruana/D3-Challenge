          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p> It's often said that it costs a lot of money to be poor and the latest data on access to healthcare
            and income level from the US Census Bureau backs this up. The above scatterplot compares poverty levels
            with access to healthcare by State, demonstrating a clear correlation between poverty levels and a lack of 
            healthcare. In most US states, living in poverty means not having access to healthcare.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            Similarly, US Census Bureau data shows that large segments of the US population still lack access to 
            healthcare regardless of age. However, there is a clear cluster of those in the population lacking 
            healthcare in their late 30s, a side effect of the gig economy. As fewer employers offer benefited postiions,
            young, relatively healthy people may not see the incentive to purchase high-cost health insurance plans
            out-of-pocket, instead choosing to "wing it" and hope that no health emergencies pop up while uninsured.
